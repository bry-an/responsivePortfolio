                    <p>
                        I was born in Duluth, Minnesota, on the head of Lake Superior, and have spent much of my life there. I am currently a full-stack
                        web developer based in Denver. I have experience working in politics, chemistry, and aquatic toxicology.
                        My academic background is in history, biochemistry, and mathematics.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My technologies include Node, Express, React, Redux, and MongoDB. I also have experience building mobile applications with
                        React Native.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My hobbies include being ouside hiking, biking, and running. I also thoroughly enjoy music, both consuming it and creating
                        it. My preferred instrument for creation is piano, and I will occasionally pick up a ukulele. With
                        the rest of my time, I enjoy geeking out with machine learning and math.
